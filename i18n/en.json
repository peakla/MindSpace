  "article_stress_p2": "In small doses, stress can be beneficial. It can help you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life—giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident.",

  "article_stress_p4": "This is the most common form of stress. It comes from demands and pressures of the recent past and anticipated demands and pressures of the near future. Acute stress is thrilling and exciting in small doses, but too much is exhausting. Examples include a job interview, a first date, or a deadline at work.",

  "faq_a10": "Focus on your breathing - try the 4-7-8 technique (breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8). Ground yourself by naming 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. Remind yourself that panic attacks are temporary and not dangerous. If panic attacks are recurring, consider speaking with a mental health professional.",
  "faq_a2": "When you call a crisis line, you'll be connected with a trained counselor who will listen without judgment. They'll help you work through what you're feeling, provide support, and help you create a plan to stay safe. You don't need to be suicidal to call - any mental health crisis is valid.",
  "faq_a3": "Consider seeking professional help if your feelings are affecting your daily life, relationships, work, or school. Signs include persistent sadness, anxiety, changes in sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, or thoughts of self-harm. Remember: seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.",
  "faq_a4": "Yes, all counseling sessions are confidential. Mental health professionals are bound by strict privacy laws and ethical guidelines. The only exceptions are if there's an immediate risk of harm to yourself or others, or in cases involving abuse of minors or vulnerable adults.",
  "faq_a5": "There are many low-cost or free mental health options available. Community mental health centers often offer sliding-scale fees based on income. Many therapists offer reduced rates, and some nonprofits provide free counseling. Crisis lines like 988 are always free, and support groups can be a valuable no-cost resource.",
  "faq_a6": "Listen without judgment and let them know you care. Avoid trying to \"fix\" their problems - sometimes just being present is enough. Encourage them to seek professional help, and offer to help them find resources or accompany them to an appointment. Take any mention of self-harm seriously and don't be afraid to involve a trusted adult or crisis line if needed.",
  "faq_a7": "Therapists and counselors provide talk therapy and may have various credentials (LCSW, LPC, MFT). Psychologists have doctoral degrees and can provide therapy and psychological testing. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who can prescribe medication. Many people work with a combination - for example, a therapist for regular sessions and a psychiatrist for medication management.",
  "faq_a8": "Absolutely! It's very common to feel anxious about opening up to a stranger. A good therapist will understand this and help you feel comfortable at your own pace. Remember, you're in control of what you share and when. If after a few sessions you don't feel a connection, it's okay to try a different therapist - finding the right fit is important.",
  "faq_a9": "It varies greatly depending on your goals and situation. Some people benefit from short-term therapy (8-12 sessions) for specific issues like anxiety or stress management. Others may continue longer for deeper work or ongoing support. Your therapist will work with you to set goals and regularly assess your progress.",
