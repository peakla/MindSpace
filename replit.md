## System Architecture

### Core Design
MindBalance is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, employing a component-based styling approach with a strong focus on accessibility and user experience.

### Frontend
-   **Structure & Styling**: Multiple static HTML pages, custom CSS with a robust custom properties system for theming, and Poppins font family.
-   **Interactivity**: Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and managing user preferences.
-   **Animation System**: Comprehensive shared animation library (`css/animations.css` and `js/animations.js`) providing:
    - Scroll-triggered animations via IntersectionObserver (fade-in, slide-up, slide-left, slide-right, scale-in, blur-in)
    - Staggered card reveal animations for grids
    - Hover effects (lift, scale, glow, 3D tilt, shine)
    - Continuous animations (float, pulse, shimmer, bounce)
    - Enhanced quote-block component with floating animation and decorative elements
    - Back-to-top button with bounce animation
    - Full dark mode support for all animations
    - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility

-   **Multilingual Support**: Supports 6 languages (English, Spanish, French, Chinese Simplified, Hindi, Korean) using `data-translate` attributes and JSON-based translation files. Language preference persists in localStorage. A CSV master file (`translations.csv`) is the single source of truth for translations, with Python scripts to generate JSON files and audit for completeness.
