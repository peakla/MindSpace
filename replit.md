## System Architecture

### Core Design
MindBalance is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, employing a component-based styling approach with a strong focus on accessibility and user experience.

### Frontend
-   **Structure & Styling**: Multiple static HTML pages, custom CSS with a robust custom properties system for theming, and Poppins font family.
-   **Interactivity**: Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and managing user preferences.
-   **Animation System**: Comprehensive shared animation library (`css/animations.css` and `js/animations.js`) providing:
    - Scroll-triggered animations via IntersectionObserver (fade-in, slide-up, slide-left, slide-right, scale-in, blur-in)
    - Staggered card reveal animations for grids
    - Hover effects (lift, scale, glow, 3D tilt, shine)
    - Continuous animations (float, pulse, shimmer, bounce)
    - Enhanced quote-block component with floating animation and decorative elements
    - Back-to-top button with bounce animation
    - Full dark mode support for all animations
    - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
-   **Accessibility**: Comprehensive settings panel offering 7 options (Dark Mode, Font Size, High Contrast, Colorblind modes, Focus Mode, Dyslexia Font, Reduced Motion) with preferences persisted via localStorage.
-   **Enhanced Settings Modal** (`css/settings-modal.css` and `js/settings-modal.js`): Full-featured modal experience with:
    - First-time onboarding wizard for new users
    - Tabbed navigation (Appearance, Accessibility, Reading, Language)
    - Theme presets (Calm Ocean, Warm Sunset, Forest Green, Night Mode, High Contrast) with live preview
    - Before/After comparison toggle for accessibility settings
    - Accessibility score ring with real-time calculation
    - Profile sync indicator showing when settings are saved to account
    - Reset buttons per section and master reset to defaults
    - Keyboard navigation (Escape to close, Tab cycling)
    - Full dark mode support with purple accent colors
    - Integrated across all 21+ pages
-   **User Accent Color System**: Theme-aware accent color picker with 8 color options (gold, purple, blue, green, teal, pink, orange, red). Applied via CSS custom properties (`--user-accent`, `--user-accent-hover`, `--user-accent-rgb`, `--user-accent-glow`) at `:root` level. Default accent is gold-crayola (#af916d) for light mode and purple (#9b7ed9) for dark mode. User-selected accent persists independently of theme and is applied to all interactive elements (buttons, links, progress bars, TOC pills, TTS controls, scrollbars).
-   **Responsiveness**: Full responsive design with orientation lock messages and safe area support.
-   **Responsive Design System** (`css/responsive-system.css`): Comprehensive responsive framework providing:
    - Fluid typography scale using clamp() for seamless scaling (--fs-display through --fs-tiny)

    - Container, card, and section utility classes (resp-container, resp-card, resp-section)
    - Print styles and reduced motion support
    - Integrated across all 21+ pages
-   **Multilingual Support**: Supports 6 languages (English, Spanish, French, Chinese Simplified, Hindi, Korean) using `data-translate` attributes and JSON-based translation files. Language preference persists in localStorage. A CSV master file (`translations.csv`) is the single source of truth for translations, with Python scripts to generate JSON files and audit for completeness.
